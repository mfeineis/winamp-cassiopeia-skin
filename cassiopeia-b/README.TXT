Cassiopeia Amp 
--------------
Version B by Martin Feineis
mail: no-id@web.de

This is the very first Winamp skin I actually finished 
to do and it was some kind of challenging I have to admit.

Features:  
- supports every type of window I was able to open with 
  winamp 2.95 :)	

I used the template amp by Mischa Klement to design the 
skin and it worked out really good, took a lot of time but 
it finally came to an end. 
Thanks to Mischa for this skin, it helped a lot to determine 
the correct positions of the elements.

In addition I used the REGION.txt from Justin for some 
windows.

Hope you enjoy it!
